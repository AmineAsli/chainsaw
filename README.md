# chainsaw
chainsaw is able to automatically mitigate suspected DDoS attacks and keeps track of the activities in a log file for later countermeasures.

chainsaw is intending in the first place to replace the well known **DDoS Deflate** which is unfortunately no longer supported and error-prone. 

## Usage
For better results run chainsaw as a cron job, for example :

    * * * * * /path/to/chainsaw

    # chainsaw -h
